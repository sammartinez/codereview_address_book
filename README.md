## Description

_{The appication is designed to have a user input information such as a name of the person, their phone number, and the person's address. They also have the options to delete all of their entires they have put in. Currently, there is only a delete all function, possibly in later versions there will be a option to just delete one entry.}_

- Also running the command line on a apple's terminal application : php -S localhost:8000 in order to see it on the client machine.
