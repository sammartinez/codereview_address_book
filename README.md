# Address Book

##### _{Users have the ability to add, save, and delete entries they input into their contact list.}, {August 7th, 2015}_

#### By Sam Martinez

## Description

The application is designed to have a user input information such as a name of the person, their phone number, and the person's address. They also have the options to delete all of their entires they have put in. Currently, there is only a delete all function, possibly in later versions there will be a option to just delete one entry.

## Setup

* In order to make sure the application runs properly I have listed the general apps you'll need installed below:
- Silex
- Twig
- Composer
- Also running the command line on a apple's terminal application : php -S localhost:8000 in order to see it on the client machine.

## Technologies Used

- Silex, Twig, Composer, PHP
